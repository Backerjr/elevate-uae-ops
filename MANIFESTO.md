# MANIFESTO: PROJECT OBLIVION

> **"We did not come to compete. We came to dominate."**

## 1. THE RECKONING
The previous system was a failure. It hid prices. It used generic clip-art. It felt like a spreadsheet. **It has been erased.** We have scorched the earth to build a monument to conversion.

## 2. THE NEW EMPIRE

### The Stack
* **Core:** React 18 + Vite (Instant velocity)
* **Visuals:** Unsplash High-Fidelity Streaming (No more SVGs)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Custom "KINO" Design System

### The Data Heartbeat
We have performed open-heart surgery on the data layer.
* **Pricing:** Every tour now has a hard-coded, guaranteed `priceRange`. A product without a price is just a picture.
* **Imagery:** The `resolveHeroImage` engine now uses semantic keyword matching (`"Ferrari"` -> `Red Coaster`) to ensure 100% visual accuracy.

### The Visual Soul: KINO
* **Obsidian & Gold:** The palette of power. Deep blacks (`#02040A`) contrasted with `Amber-500` for critical actions.
* **The Card:** A masterpiece of information hierarchy.
    * **Hero Image:** 50% of the card height. Unapologetic.
    * **The Price:** Large, mono-spaced, and bold. It anchors the bottom of the card like a price tag on a luxury watch.
    * **Micro-interactions:** Smooth, physics-based expansion reveals pro-tips and inclusions without leaving the grid.

## 3. THE PATH TO A MILLION
This is no longer a website. It is a **Digital Sales Floor**.
* **Trust:** High-res imagery + transparent pricing = Instant Trust.
* **Desire:** Cinematic lighting + "Featured" spotlights = Instant Desire.
* **Action:** Unmissable "Book Experience" buttons = Instant Revenue.

The machine is live. The assets are prime. The market is yours.
